# Gesture Controlled Drone (6dof simulation using hand gestures)
___
## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to develop web-based demonstration to visualize intuitive and fluid control over 3D object using hand-based gesture controls. Project focuses on collection of data to train model, development of gesture detection model using Keras, and deployment of said model in a web app. Gesture classification is done via sequential dense neural network with three hidden layers; whereas its deployment in the form of web app is done using React JS and Three JS. End goal of project is to create a web app which can control a 3D object using hand gesture fed from webcam.
